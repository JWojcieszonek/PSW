                    "I am the 37th Prince of the Elemira Kingdom, son of the Mad King Roedran. I have come to beseech thee, O Gods, for your blessing in earning the throne. My offering will be the deaths of my other brothers, a thousand silver pieces and a 100 gold pieces from my personal coffers, as well as a shrine in your name."

                    Xioden intoned quietly at the Altar of Sanctuary, doing his best to not laugh at the absurdity of the whole process. His Ancestor, the Tyrant King had been the one to start the throne ritual. He had taken many wives in his life, some from within his kingdom and others from foreign land. And he had hated them all. So, on his deathbed, he made it a rule. Any one of his princes could take the throne after him, but they had to prove themselves in the arena. They had to fight, and kill and win.
